        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>The idea for MyFitnessCompanion was born out of a personal struggle to maintain a consistent fitness routine and balanced diet. After trying various tools and methods, we realized that there was a need for a comprehensive, user-friendly platform that could streamline the process of tracking and managing one's fitness and nutrition data. Drawing inspiration from our own experiences and extensive research into health and wellness, we set out to develop MyFitnessCompanion as a solution to help individuals like ourselves take control of their health and make lasting lifestyle changes.</p>
